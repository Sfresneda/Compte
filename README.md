## Description
Compte is a clicker (counter) app designed to help you keep track of all the repetitive actions you carry out in your day-to-day life. With its simple and intuitive design, Compte makes tracking your actions a breeze: just create a board and start recording with a single tap.

Ever wonder how many times you've walked the dog this week, or whether you've taken out the trash yet? Are you playing a role-playing game and need to keep track of your "farming" actions? With Compte, you can record all these actions simply and effectively.

Compte's philosophy is to allow the user to perform all possible actions in the simplest possible way, all while respecting how the app uses the device's resources. In addition to its ease of use, Compte is highly customizable, letting you create multiple boards and set custom names for each of them. It also supports dark mode, providing a comfortable user experience in any lighting environment.

Whether you're looking for a way to keep track of your daily habits, boost your productivity, or just keep count of the things that matter, Compte is here to make your life a little easier.
